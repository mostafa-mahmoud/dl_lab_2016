\section{Introduction}
This is a report about the deep learning lab, exercise 3. The general task of this assignment was to use Tensorflow/keras to implement a convolutional neural network to train it on solving a search problem and compare it to the A* search algorithm. As well as trying different configurations and architectures of the neural networks.

\section{Search problem}
The given problem was find a target position in a given maze. We were given a simulator that can visualize our algorithm or the given reference A* algorithm. 

\section{Architecture}
\begin{itemize}
\item Input: There was a given script that generates the train/validation data according to the A* algorithm. It starts from a variety of random positions and tries to search for the target. The A* reaches the target optimally.

\item Network: We used Keras to implement our neural network. We implemented a network that consists of 2 fully-connected layers followed by 3 convolutional layers. some tests and 3 layers in some other tests, we tried a variety of number of neurons in layers. We tried different activation functions on some layers (like tanh), mostly the relu showed the best results.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
We tried different configuration for the running.
\begin{itemize}
\item Smaller local view: This possibility lead for an accuracy of ~80\%
\item Different history length: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 10: 15/20 tests lead to 100\% accuracy, 4/20 to 96\% and 1/20 to 92\% accuracies respectively.
		\item 6: 19/20 tests lead to 100\% accuracy and 1/20 to 96\%.
		\item 4: 15/20 tests lead to 100\% accuracy and 5/20 to 96\%.
	\end{itemize}
\item Changing the target after training: Lead to accuracy ~45\%, there was an interesting observation in this case, that the agent was smart enough to learn from it's own mistakes; in the sense that after it goes in a dead end path, it can go back and try different paths. Sometimes there was enough steps remaining to achieve the goal, sometimes not.
\item Changing the map after training: lead to 0\% accuracy, it got stuck in a lot of parts of the map because it was so unfamiliar.


\end{itemize}

%% Adding Figure and Table References
%% Be sure to add figures and tables after \end{article}
%% and before \end{document}

%% For figures, put the caption below the illustration.
%%
%% \begin{figure}
%% \caption{Almost Sharp Front}\label{afoto}
%% \end{figure}
\iffalse
\begin{figure}[h]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{2L3C.png}}
\caption{2 Layers, 3 Channels, Accuracy: 89\%}\label{placeholder}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{2L4C.png}}
\caption{2 Layers, 4 Channels, Accuracy: 91\%}\label{placeholder}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{3L3C.png}}
\caption{3 Layers, 3 Channels, Accuracy: 92\%}\label{placeholder}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{3L4C.png}}
\caption{3 Layers, 4 Channels, 87\%}\label{placeholder}
\end{figure}
\fi
%% For Tables, put caption above table
%%
%% Table caption should start with a capital letter, continue with lower case
%% and not have a period at the end
%% Using @{\vrule height ?? depth ?? width0pt} in the tabular preamble will
%% keep that much space between every line in the table.

%% \begin{table}
%% \caption{Repeat length of longer allele by age of onset class}
%% \begin{tabular}{@{\vrule height 10.5pt depth4pt  width0pt}lrcccc}
%% table text
%% \end{tabular}
%% \end{table}

%% For two column figures and tables, use the following:

%% \begin{figure*}
%% \caption{Almost Sharp Front}\label{afoto}
%% \end{figure*}

%% \begin{table*}
%% \caption{Repeat length of longer allele by age of onset class}
%% \begin{tabular}{ccc}
%% table text
%% \end{tabular}
%% \end{table*}
